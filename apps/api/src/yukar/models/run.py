"""Run / state.yaml models — spec §4.2.

Run-state vocabulary (lifecycle redesign):
- ``running`` / ``paused`` — a turn is actually EXECUTING (these are the only
  states that hold the epic's run slot).
- ``waiting``   — the single resting state: "your turn".  A conversation run
  parks here after every turn (and stays here across restarts).  An epic that
  has never run is also synthesised as ``waiting``.
- ``error``     — the run crashed with an unhandled exception.
- ``completed`` — JOB runs only (resolve / arbiter): finite jobs have an end.
  Conversation runs never write it — a conversation has no end (principle 2);
  the fake-provider DummyRunner also settles in ``waiting``.

``role`` (lifecycle redesign) records WHICH conversation agent the run
belongs to — ``manager`` or ``reviewer`` — so REST restore can attribute
"your turn" to the right thread and label it correctly.  ``thread_id`` is
"the conversation thread this run rides on" (for a reviewer run it points at
the reviewer thread).

Legacy compatibility (old state.yaml files stay loadable):
- Legacy statuses (``idle`` / ``awaiting_input`` / ``interrupted``) are read
  back as ``waiting`` via a BeforeValidator.
- The legacy ``manager_thread`` key (renamed to ``thread_id`` in the
  lifecycle redesign) is read
  back via a before-mode model_validator (lazy migration — persisted under
  the new key on the next save).
- The removed ``pending_question`` key in old files is ignored by pydantic's
  default extra handling; a missing ``role`` key defaults to ``manager``.
